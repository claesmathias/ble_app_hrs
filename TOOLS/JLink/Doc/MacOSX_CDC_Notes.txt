Special attention needed for J-Link OB with CDC functionality under Mac OS X:
Due to a limitation of the Mac OS X CDC kernel driver, J-Link OBs with CDC functionality
can not be used as CDC device + J-Link at the same time when used on Mac OS X.
For using the J-Link functionality, the CDC driver of Mac OS X needs to be disabled temporarily.
In order to use the CDC functionality, the CDC driver needs to be enabled again.

How to use J-Link functionality:
- Double click Samples\CDCDisable.term (execution requires root access rights)
- Physically disconnect & reconnect J-Link to Mac


How to use CDC functionality again:
- Double click Samples\CDCEnable.term (execution requires root access rights)
- Physically disconnect & reconnect J-Link to Mac
