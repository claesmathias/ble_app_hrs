 * @ingroup app_common
 *
 * @brief UART module implementation.
 *
 * @details The UART module can be used for control of the UART.
 *          It has a low power mode that will be enabled when RTS/CTS flowcontrol is enabled.
 *          The UART peripheral will be turned off whenever the CTS signal from the remote side is
 *          high, and when CTS becomes low (active) the UART peripheral will be enabled.
 *
 *          <b>Asynchron nature</b>
 *
 *          The UART module will recieve bytes from the RXD register when an EVENT_RXDRDY interrupt
 *          has occured. The byte will be put into the RX FIFO and can be fetched by the 
 *          application using @ref app_uart_get. First byte recieved and placed in the RX FIFO will 
 *          trigger an APP_UART_DATA_READY event. 
 *
 *          The @ref app_uart_put will place the provided byte in the TX FIFO.
 *          Bytes in the TX FIFO will be written to the TXD register by the app_uart module.
 *          When a byte is sucessfully transfered an EVENT_TXDRDY interrupt is triggered. The 
 *          interrupt handler in the app_uart module will fetch the next byte from the FIFO and 
 *          write it to the TXD register. 
 *          The application can call @ref app_uart_put to request transmission of bytes.
 *
 *          <b>Error handling</b>
 *
 *          An error flag is set in the UART peripheral in event of an error during data reception. 
 *          The error will be propagated to the application event handler as an 
 *          @ref app_uart_evt_t containg APP_UART_ERROR_SOURCE in the evt_type field. The 
 *          data.error_source field will contain the original error source information from the 
 *          UART peripheral register. 
 *
 *          In case the RX FIFO is full when data are received an @ref app_uart_evt_t containg 
 *          APP_UART_NRF_ERROR in the evt_type field will be generated and sent to the application.
 *          The event will contain the original error code from the FIFO in the data.error_code 
 *          field.
 *
 *          <b>UART with flow control</b>
 *
 *          When UART is configured to use flow control it will use low power mode when possible.
 *          The UART peripheral will be de-activated when the CTS signal from the remote side is 
 *          set to inactive state. When CTS is set active by the remote side, the UART peripheral
 *          will be activated.
 *
 *          The STARTTX register will be enabled when data are available in the TX FIFO and CTS is
 *          active.
 *
 *          The application should use @ref app_uart_get_connection_state to ensure that the nRF51
 *          chip only power off when the UART peripheral is disconnected. When the nRF51 chip is in
 *          power off mode the remote side can wake up the nRF51 chip by setting the CTS to active 
 *          state. 
 *
 * @image   html uart_state_machine_tx_with_flow_control.png "UART with flow control enabled state machine diagram."
 *
 * @note    When using RTS/CTS flowcontrol the CTS pin will be monitored by the GPIOTE. To register
 *          the UART module as a user of app_gpiote run the GPIOTE_INIT(X) macro to initialize
 *          the module with the X number of users. X will be the number of all app_gpiote users of
 *          the whole application.
 *
 * @par     UART without flow control
 *
 *          When using the app_uart module without flow control the UART will not use GPIOTE. CTS will
 *          not work as a signal for the UART to stop the RX peripheral. Thus the UART RX will
 *          always be on.
