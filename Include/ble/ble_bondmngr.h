 * @brief Module for handling multiple bonds.
 *
 * @details The Bond Manager interacts with the BLE stack by reacting to a set of BLE stack events,
 *          thus helping the application to bond with multiple masters.
 *
 *          Applications using the Bond Manager must have a configuration file named
 *          ble_bondmngr_cfg.h (see below for details).
 *
 *          Sequence diagrams illustrating the flow of events when connecting to a master using the
 *          Bond Manager:
 *
 *          @image html bond_manager_unbonded_master.jpg Figure 1: Connecting to an unbonded master
 *          @n
 *          @image html bond_manager_bonded_master.jpg Figure 2: Connecting to a bonded master
 *
 * @section ble_sdk_lib_bond_manager_cfg Configuration File
 * Applications using the Bond Manager must have a configuration file named ble_bondmngr_cfg.h.
 * Here is an example of this file:
 * 
 * @code
 * #ifndef BLE_BONDMNGR_CFG_H__
 * #define BLE_BONDMNGR_CFG_H__
 * 
 * #define BLE_BONDMNGR_CCCD_COUNT          1
 * #define BLE_BONDMNGR_MAX_BONDED_MASTERS  4
 * 
 * #endif // BLE_BONDMNGR_CFG_H__
 * @endcode
 * 
 * BLE_BONDMNGR_CCCD_COUNT is the number of CCCDs used in the application, and
 * BLE_BONDMNGR_MAX_BONDED_MASTERS is the maximum number of bonded masters to be supported by the
 * application.
